### New Buttons
 Added a new row of buttons at the top of the calculator - making it the first row of buttons.  It has to be below the number output and above the “AC, +/-, %, /“ buttons. Include a screenshot showing you adding the row and the empty buttons in the writeup document (10 points)
	
### New CSS Class
Created a new CSS class with a different background color for these new buttons. Buttons should be the same size as the others and the text should be bold on the buttons (15)*
	Created a new class called “NewFunctions” and set the background color to “crimson”
	Ran into the bug where the bottom row of buttons was squished and too short. I changed the row number from 5 to 6 to accommodate the new 	 row of functions. The buttons are the same sizes as the rest now. 

### CSS Formatting
The text on each of the buttons is the same font, weight, and size. The functions I plan on implementing are: SQRT, SQR, X^3, and |X|
I committed the changes above to the GitHub repository. 

### Functions Implemented
Implemented 4 new functions - one for each button and implement them (25)
The Functions I implemented:
SQRT: which is the square root of a number function
SQR: Which is the square of a number function
X^3: which is the cube of a number function 
|X|: which is the absolute value of a number function 

### Outputs Stay Within Digital Readout
Output results do stay within the digital readout. 
I committed all my changes to the GitHub repository and updated the ReadMe document.

### Notes on the data Keys:
The Data Keys that accompany the different buttons have been edited from the original CALC YA LATER source code. I have changed them because not all of them worked with my computer keyboard keys.  As they are now they will work with my computer. 

Some of the new data keys i included so that my functions will work with my keyboard are as follows:
Type (on keyboard) "s" for SQRT
Type (on keyboard) "t" for SQR
Type (on keyboard) "r" for X^3 
Type (on keyboard) "|" for absolute vaule |X|

For my calculator the following keyboard keys will do the following operations: 

(equals) ---> the enter/ return  key
(multiply) ---> the 'x' key
(add)---> the "=/+" key
(subtract) ---> the '-' key
(clear) ---> the backspace key

The rest of the operations and functions retain the keybinds from the original "CALC YA LATER" source code
