### New Buttons
 Added a new row of buttons at the top of the calculator - making it the first row of buttons.  It has to be below the number output and above the “AC, +/-, %, /“ buttons. Include a screenshot showing you adding the row and the empty buttons in the writeup document (10 points)
	
### New CSS Class
Created a new CSS class with a different background color for these new buttons. Buttons should be the same size as the others and the text should be bold on the buttons (15) <br/>

Created a new class called “NewFunctions” and set the background color to “crimson”
Ran into the bug where the bottom row of buttons was squished and too short. I changed the row number from 5 to 6 to accommodate the new row of functions. The buttons are the same sizes as the rest now. 

### CSS Formatting
The text on each of the buttons is the same font, weight, and size. The functions I plan on implementing are: SQRT, SQR, X^3, and |X|
I committed the changes above to the GitHub repository. 

### Functions Implemented
Implemented 4 new functions - one for each button and implement them (25)<br/>
The Functions I implemented:<br/>
SQRT: which is the square root of a number function <br/>
SQR: Which is the square of a number function <br/>
X^3: which is the cube of a number function <br/>
|X|: which is the absolute value of a number function <br/>

### Outputs Stay Within Digital Readout
Output results do stay within the digital readout. <br/>
I committed all my changes to the GitHub repository and updated the ReadMe document.<br/>

### Notes on the data Keys:
The Data Keys that accompany the different buttons have been edited from the original CALC YA LATER source code. I have changed them because not all of them worked with my computer keyboard keys.  As they are now they will work with my computer. <br/>

Some of the new data keys i included so that my functions will work with my keyboard are as follows:<br/>
Type (on keyboard) "s" for SQR T<br/>
Type (on keyboard) "t" for SQR <br/>
Type (on keyboard) "r" for X^3 <br/>
Type (on keyboard) "|" for absolute vaule |X| <br/>

For my calculator the following keyboard keys will do the following operations: <br/>

(equals) ---> the enter/ return  key <br/>
(multiply) ---> the 'x' key <br/>
(add)---> the "=/+" key <br/>
(subtract) ---> the '-' key <br/>
(clear) ---> the backspace key <br/>

The rest of the operations and functions retain the keybinds from the original "CALC YA LATER" source code <br/>
